            <span class="body-ital">Gretchen Bender: So Much Deathless</span> was the first posthumous retrospective presenting the life and work of the new media artist Gretchen Bender (1951–2004). In addition to presenting works across video, sculpture, computer graphics, photography, print and installation-based work, the exhibition brought together archival materials and a robust oral history featuring former friends and collaborators&mdash;including Robert Longo, Vernon Reid, Bill T. Jones, Amber Denker, Stuart Argabright, Vera Dika and many more.

          Organized in collaboration with the Gretchen Bender Estate and Cay-Sophie Rabinowitz. The exhibition was accompanied by public programming organized into four categories&mdash;Meet the Makers, Virtual Histories, Exhibition Tours, and Off-Site Programs. In addition to daily screenings, we also presented a live score of Bender’s largest work of “electronic theatre,” <span class="body-ital">Total Recall</span> (1987), performed by the original composer Stuart Argabright. At the Brooklyn-based performance venue ISSUE Project Room, we presented a special evening of experimental music and audio-visual expansion dedicated to <span class="body-ital">So Much Deathless</span>, the title of Bender’s third and final electronic theater piece, left unrealized due to her passing in 2004.
