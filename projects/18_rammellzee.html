          <span class="body-ital">RAMMΣLLZΣΣ: Racing for Thunder</span> presented the work of Gothic Futurist Rammellzee, featuring an eclectic array of artworks, music, writings, rare archival documentation, and ephemera, gathered from disparate sources around the world, to outline a chronology of his life and legacy.
          <br><br>
          Told by those whose life he orbited, the exhibition included an oral history project featuring TOXIC, Kool Koor, Lee Quiñones, Jim Jarmusch, Eszter Balint, and many more. The oral histories helped frame Rammellzee’s influence while bringing together a shared history about the man behind the myth.

          <br>
          Public programs were organized across slideshows and live performances, artist-led gallery tours, and arts education workshops for students.

          <br><br><br>

          <a class="project-text-link--programs ramm-1" href="https://redbullarts.com/newyork/news/no-guts-no-galaxy/" target="_blank">
            <span class="program-title">NO GUTS NO GALAXY</span><br>
            The format of this weekly series of artist-curated slideshows took inspiration from an audio recording of a slideshow/performance called RAMMΣLLZΣΣ: UNDERGROUND INNER THINKING (1987), given by the artist at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, where, in between impromptu freestyles and bouts of audience heckling, Rammellzee espoused his philosophical tenets of Gothic Futurism and Ikonoklast Panzerism. Presenters for NO GUTS, NO GALAXY included artists, photographers, writers, curators, and musicians, many of whom shared a common history and personal connection with Rammellzee, or have found inspiration in the artist’s diverse, interdisciplinary output. Participants included: Kenneth Goldsmith, Steffani Jemison, Charlie Ahearn, Kool Koor, Carlo McCormick, Black Quantum Futurism, Seth Tillett (narrated by The RAMM:ELL:ZEE), Death Comet Crew, and D. Denenge Duyst-Akpem.

            <span class="program-title">GLOWING CREATION: A Rammellzee-inspired Opera</span><br>
            Over the course of six weeks—inspired by Rammellzee’s unique brand of performance art and ornate costumery—a group of students, under the tutelage of visiting artists, designed personalized Tyvek suits and masks, created musical tracks, and developed singular performances featuring their own interpretive break-dancing and choreography. Workshops were led by Kool Koor, Tau Lewis, and Standing on the Corner’s Gio Escobar. At the end of the summer, a selection of students showcased the culmination of their six-week arts program at the Abrons Playhouse Theater. The event also featured the screening of the iconic documentary <span class="body-ital">Style Wars</span> (1983), a film chronicling the birth of hip hop culture in the ‘70s and ‘80s. Organized in collaboration with Chantara Ellis, Director of School & Community Programs, Abrons Arts Center.
