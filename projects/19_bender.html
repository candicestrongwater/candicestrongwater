        <div class="project-text__container">
            <span class="body-ital">Gretchen Bender: So Much Deathless</span> is the first posthumous retrospective presenting the life and work of the new media artist Gretchen Bender (1951–2004). In addition to presenting works across video, sculpture, computer graphics, photography, print and installation, the exhibition brought together archival materials and a robust oral history featuring friends and collaborators: Robert Longo, Vernon Reid, Bill T. Jones, Amber Denker, Stuart Argabright, Vera Dika and many more. Organized in collaboration with the Gretchen Bender Estate.

            <br><br>

            The exhibition was accompanied by public programming organized into four categories&mdash;Meet the Makers, Virtual Histories, Exhibition Tours, and Off-Site Programs. In addition to daily screenings, we presented a live score of Bender’s largest work of “electronic theatre,” <span class="body-ital">Total Recall</span> (1987), performed by the original composer Stuart Argabright. At the Brooklyn-based performance venue ISSUE Project Room, we presented a special evening of experimental music and audio-visual expansion dedicated to <span class="body-ital">So Much Deathless</span>, the title of Bender’s third and final electronic theater piece, left unrealized due to her passing in 2004. Exhibition tours led by friends, artists, and contemporaries of Bender included Michelle Grabner, Amber Denker, Cay-Sophie Rabinowitz, and Peter Nagy.

            <span class="program-title">Meet the Makers</span><br>
            Originally presented at the Donnell Media Center on 53rd Street, <span class="body-ital">Meet The Makers</span> was a long-standing series that invited artists, media activists, and film organizers to screen and discuss their work. On occasion of <span class="body-ital">Gretchen Bender: So Much Deathless</span>, we reprised this groundbreaking platform, celebrating the Reserve Film and Video Collection’s rich history of media arts education and connecting Bender to our current community of media makers. Organized in collaboration with The Reserve Film and Video Collection of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts (formerly DMC), featuring Eva & Franco Mattes, Pamela M. Lee, Solveig Nelson, Meriem Bennani, Jlin, DIS, Rick Prelinger, Shu Lea Cheang.

            <span class="program-title">Virtual Histories</span><br>
            A special series of film and video screenings that used Bender’s notion of deathlessness as a framework. The program presented short video works and feature films by artists who explore multi-dimensional memory, alternative scenarios, and imaginary time, featuring films by Antoni Muntadas, Jacolby Satterwhite, Andrew Norman Wilson, Robert Longo, and special selections from the Gretchen Bender Estate.
