          <span class="body-ital">Remix Rememory</span> was a site-responsive exhibition that gathered and reimagined histories as a means to understand personal and collective identities. Featuring borrowed and commissioned works by artists from Jamaica, Queens, and beyond, the exhibition and related public programming explored how memories can be recaptured and preserved through actions, objects, and reframed tales.
          <br><br>
          <span class="body-ital">Remix Rememory</span> took place in an empty storefront inside The Jamaica Colosseum Mall, an active commercial center that has served as a landmark in hip-hop fashion and music culture since the 1980s. With over 100 independent vendors, including a dental office, food court, hair salons, and spaces of worship and healing, the Mall is a haven for small business owners and consumers, and serves as a site of cultural and capital exchange. The works included in <span class="body-ital">Remix Rememory</span> engaged with the blended space of the Mall—exploring, examining, and recreating local and global archival histories, creative healing, and activism. The exhibition title was conceived in response to the rapidly changing neighborhood. It speaks to the idea of sampling and synthesizing elements of hip-hop music, and Toni Morrison’s concept of rememory—the intentional revisiting of memories.

            In partnership with Jamaica Center for Arts & Learning (JCAL), Zalika Azim and I facilitated an artist-walk through and conversation for the JCAL exhibition, <span class="body-ital">Undissed and Very Able</span>. The exhibition featured a wide range of photographs and digital collages created by over twenty photographers and artists from the Progressive Visions Photo Club. Established in 1997 in Woodside, Queens, the Progressive Visions Photo Club (founded by Jim Interlicchio) works with photographers and artists with various abilities and disabilities as they explore and photograph New York City neighborhoods.

            Artists include: Patrick Emproto, Frank Ferebee, Pedro Cruz, Charles Scaturro and Jennifer Ramos, who guided visitors through their work, sharing techniques related to the use of DSLRs (digital single-lens reflex cameras), RAW capable point and shoot, adaptive gear, and the role that photography plays in redefining the self through collage and portraiture.
